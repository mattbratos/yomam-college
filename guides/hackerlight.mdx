## Why

I love coding at night, but I couldn't find any cool lamp to place behind my laptop for some ambient light. So, I decided to create my own (inspired by Infowski at Warsaw Hacker Space).

## What do you need?

**Materials**

- Old lamp (I bought mine from olx.pl, but eBay or your mama's basement should also work)
- ESP32 microcontroller
- WS2812B LED strip (length depends on your design; for my project, I used ~2.5m of 60 LEDs per meter strip)
- Power supply (capacity depends on the number of LEDs. Generally, you need 5V. For my project, 10A was more than enough)
- Micro-USB cable (to connect the ESP32 to your laptop)
- Jumper wires

**Tools**

- Laptop
- Soldering iron and accessories

## Setup & Learning

There are many tutorials online on how to set it up, so watch them carefully to avoid some stupid mistakes. I followed this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exAWzMfmwQ8).
You can also watch this [Soldering Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apSz3NXYlx8) if you are new to this topic.

## Building

Now, what you need to do is rip apart the old lamp and put inside it the LED strip, ESP32, and power supply.

## Connecting

Then, you need to connect your ESP32 to the internet. Follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEnFKLm9Sw&).
