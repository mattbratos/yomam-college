# Chapter 9: Building a Simple Web Server

## Introduction to the Chapter's Topic

Welcome to Chapter 9 of *Internet 101*! In this chapter, we're diving into an exciting hands-on project: building a simple web server on a Linux machine. This chapter will provide you with the foundational skills needed to set up your own web server, understand its components, and serve a basic webpage. Let's break down the steps to achieve this.

By the end of this chapter, you will:

- Understand what a web server is and its role in web communication.
- Be able to set up a Linux environment conducive for running a web server.
- Install and configure an essential web server software (Apache).
- Serve a basic HTML webpage from your web server.

## Introduction to Web Servers

### What is a Web Server?

A web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve files that form webpages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients. This process is fundamental to the operation of the internet and enables webpages to be viewed in a browser.

### Key Functions of a Web Server

- **Hosting Websites:** Storing and managing website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.).
- **Responding to Client Requests:** Responding to browser requests for website files.
- **Handling Application Logic:** Running server-side code (like PHP or Python), if configured.
- **Security Enforcement:** Implementing HTTPS for secure communication.

## Setting Up a Linux Environment

### Pre-requisites

Ensure you have the following:

- A Linux distribution installed (Ubuntu is recommended for beginners).
- Access to terminal (command line) and necessary permissions (sudo access).

### Basic Commands and Tools

Familiarize yourself with basic Linux commands:
- `sudo`: Execute commands with superuser privileges.
- `apt-get`: Package handling tool.
- `nano` or `vim`: Text editors to edit configuration files.

### Update and Upgrade Your System

Begin by updating your package lists and upgrading your installed packages to ensure you have the latest software versions:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## Installing and Configuring a Web Server

### Installing Apache

Apache is a popular open-source web server software that's easy to install and configure. To install Apache, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2
```

### Starting and Enabling Apache

Start the Apache service and ensure it runs on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
```

To confirm that Apache is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost`. You should see the Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page.

### Configuring Apache

The main configuration file for Apache is located at `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`. To make basic changes, you can open this file with a text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

For most basic configurations, this file may not need to be altered immediately. Let's focus on serving a webpage next.

## Serving a Basic Webpage

### Creating a Simple HTML Webpage

Navigate to the default directory where Apache serves files from:

```bash
cd /var/www/html
```

Create a new HTML file:

```bash
sudo nano index.html
```

Add the following HTML content to the `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Server</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web server!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Save the file and exit the text editor. You can now visit `http://localhost` in your web browser to see your new webpage!

### Practical Exercises

1. **Add More Content to Your Webpage:**
   - Modify `index.html` to include an image and some styled text. Use HTML and CSS as needed.

2. **Enable and Configure HTTPS:**
   - Research how to enable HTTPS using `Let's Encrypt` and configure Apache to serve your webpage securely.

3. **Host Multiple Websites:**
   - Configure virtual hosts in Apache to host multiple websites on the same server.

### Assignments

- **Basic Webpage Creation:** Create a webpage that includes an ordered list and an image with proper formatting.
- **Report Generation:** Document each step you took, including any challenges faced and how you resolved them.
